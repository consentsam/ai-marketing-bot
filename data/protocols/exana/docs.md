# Exana Protocol Documentation

## Introduction

Exana is a cross-chain DeFi protocol designed to optimize liquidity management and provide MEV protection. Our suite of products offers users secure and efficient ways to trade, provide liquidity, and earn yield across multiple blockchain networks.

## Core Products

### ExanaSwap

ExanaSwap is our flagship decentralized exchange (DEX) that incorporates advanced MEV protection mechanisms to prevent frontrunning and sandwich attacks.

#### Key Features:

- **MEV Protection**: All transactions are protected from miner extractable value exploitation through a combination of private mempool routing and batch execution.
- **Cross-Chain Swaps**: Seamlessly swap assets across Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base with minimal slippage.
- **Optimal Routing**: Smart order routing splits trades across multiple liquidity sources to ensure best execution prices.
- **Single-Sided Liquidity**: Provide liquidity with just one asset, eliminating the need for balanced token pairs.

#### Technical Implementation:

```solidity
function executeProtectedSwap(
    address tokenIn,
    address tokenOut,
    uint256 amountIn,
    uint256 minAmountOut,
    address recipient
) external returns (uint256 amountOut) {
    // Verify input parameters
    require(amountIn > 0, "Invalid amount");
    require(recipient != address(0), "Invalid recipient");
    
    // Transfer tokens from sender
    IERC20(tokenIn).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amountIn);
    
    // Submit order to protected execution engine
    bytes32 orderHash = submitToProtectedEngine(
        tokenIn,
        tokenOut,
        amountIn,
        minAmountOut,
        recipient
    );
    
    // Wait for execution confirmation
    amountOut = waitForExecution(orderHash);
    
    // Verify minimum output was received
    require(amountOut >= minAmountOut, "Slippage too high");
    
    return amountOut;
}
```

### ExanaYield

ExanaYield is our automated yield aggregator that dynamically adjusts strategies based on market conditions to maximize returns.

#### Key Features:

- **Auto-Compounding**: Rewards are automatically reinvested to maximize compound interest.
- **Dynamic Strategy Switching**: The protocol automatically shifts between yield strategies based on risk-adjusted returns.
- **Gas Optimization**: Batch harvesting reduces gas costs for all participants.
- **Impermanent Loss Protection**: Long-term liquidity providers receive insurance against impermanent loss.

#### Yield Strategies:

| Strategy | Risk Level | Current APY | Assets Supported |
|----------|------------|-------------|------------------|
| Conservative | Low | 8-12% | USDC, USDT, DAI |
| Balanced | Medium | 15-20% | ETH, WBTC, EXANA |
| Aggressive | High | 20-30% | EXANA-ETH LP, Various altcoins |

### ExanaShield

ExanaShield provides insurance protection for users of Exana products, covering smart contract vulnerabilities and protocol insolvency.

#### Coverage Options:

- **Smart Contract Protection**: Coverage for bugs and vulnerabilities in audited smart contracts.
- **Protocol Insolvency**: Protection against protocol bankruptcy or severe financial distress.
- **Staking Rewards**: Users who provide coverage capacity by staking EXANA tokens earn additional yield.

## Tokenomics

EXANA is the governance token of the Exana protocol with a total supply of 50 million tokens.

### Token Allocation:

- 40% - Community Rewards
- 20% - Team and Advisors
- 15% - Foundation Treasury
- 15% - Strategic Investors
- 10% - Liquidity Provision

### Token Utility:

1. **Governance**: Propose and vote on protocol changes.
2. **Fee Discounts**: Reduced trading fees on ExanaSwap.
3. **Boosted Yields**: Stake EXANA to boost yields in ExanaYield vaults.
4. **Insurance Staking**: Provide coverage capacity in ExanaShield.

## Security

Security is our top priority at Exana. We have implemented several measures to ensure the safety of user funds:

1. **Multiple Audits**: Smart contracts audited by CertiK and Peckshield.
2. **Bug Bounty**: $1M maximum bounty on Immunefi for critical vulnerabilities.
3. **Insurance Coverage**: $40M in coverage through Nexus Mutual.
4. **Timelock**: 48-hour timelock on all governance actions.
5. **Multi-sig**: Critical protocol functions protected by 5/9 multi-signature wallet.

## Governance

Exana governance operates through on-chain voting using the EXANA token:

1. **Proposal Submission**: Requires holding at least 25,000 EXANA tokens or receiving delegation.
2. **Voting Period**: All proposals have a 5-day voting period.
3. **Implementation**: Passed proposals are executed after a 48-hour timelock.
4. **Quorum Requirement**: 10% of circulating supply must participate for a valid vote.

### How does Exana governance work?

EXANA token holders can propose and vote on protocol changes through our on-chain governance system. Proposal submission requires holding at least 25,000 EXANA tokens or receiving delegation from holders with that amount. Voting power is proportional to token holdings.

### What chains does Exana support?

Exana currently supports Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base, with plans to expand to Polygon and Avalanche in Q3 2024.

### How can I earn yields on Exana?

Users can earn yields by providing liquidity to ExanaSwap pools, staking EXANA tokens, or depositing assets into ExanaYield strategies. Current APYs range from 8% to 30% depending on the asset and strategy chosen.
