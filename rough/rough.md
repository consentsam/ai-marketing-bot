My response on the first response:

My thoughts :
> Twitter API access (tweepy or python-twitter-v2), xAI API integration (assuming an SDK or REST API is available), and other utilities like requests for HTTP calls.
This should actually be a source which would give the content of the tweet and the metadata associated with it. Why this change? Because right now I haven't thought how I would go about reading tweets, so for now I want it to design in such a way that you are able to add other sources of tweet. By doing this, by defining or configuring with a file or two, the project will be setup for other sources of tweet. So, find a good data structure with relevant fields so that integrating a new data source is possible or easy. For start - I might just provide you some tweet content and relevant metadata so that you are able to make decisions as you would be if you were reading live with Twitter APIs, so that later integration with Twitter APIs is simple as it contains the same input datastructure (with non-relevant fields values set to be null)

Also, I want you to prepare a detailed step by step plan keeping these things in mind

When creating your plan, follow these guidelines:

1. Start with the core project structure and essential configurations.
2. Progress through database schema, server actions, and API routes.
4. Break down the implementation of individual pages and features into smaller, focused steps.
5. Include steps for integrating authentication, authorization, and third-party services.
6. Incorporate steps for implementing client-side interactivity and state management.
7. Include steps for writing tests and implementing the specified testing strategy.
8. Ensure that each step builds upon the previous ones in a logical manner.

Present your plan using the following markdown-based format. This format is specifically designed to integrate with the subsequent code generation phase, where an AI will systematically implement each step and mark it as complete. Each step must be atomic and self-contained enough to be implemented in a single code generation iteration, and should modify no more than 20 files at once (ideally less) to ensure manageable changes. Make sure to include any instructions the user should follow for things you can't do like installing libraries, updating configurations on services, etc (Ex: Running a SQL script for storage bucket RLS policies in the Supabase editor).

# Implementation Plan

## [Section Name]
- [ ] Step 1: [Brief title]
  - **Task**: [Detailed explanation of what needs to be implemented]
  - **Files**: [Maximum of 20 files, ideally less]
    - `path/to/file1.ts`: [Description of changes]
  - **Step Dependencies**: [Step Dependencies]
  - **User Instructions**: [Instructions for User]

[Additional steps...]
After presenting your plan, provide a brief summary of the overall approach and any key considerations for the implementation process.

Remember to:

Ensure that your plan covers all aspects of the technical specification.
Break down complex features into smaller, manageable tasks.
Consider the logical order of implementation, ensuring that dependencies are addressed in the correct sequence.
Include steps for error handling, data validation, and edge case management.
Begin your response with your brainstorming, then proceed to the creation your detailed implementation plan for the web application based on the provided specification.

Once you are done, we will pass this specification to the AI code generation system.


Please update that in the file @YieldFi-Ai-Agent-Implementation.md .  Also, ensure that if you are reading a markdown file in this project then you have to summarise that file starting of that file. 

Here are the relevant files @docs.yield.fi.md contains the docs of yeildFi. @Yield-Fi-AI-Agent-Roadmap.md  contains the requirements or implementation plan given by CTO. Please be as much descriptive as you can be. Do a detailed analysis



-----------


So, as mentioned in the @Yield-Fi-AI-Agent-Roadmap.md , there would be three types of interaction i.e. 
1. Official To Institution -> Refer to the file @InstructionsForOfficialToInstitution.md 
2. Intern to Intern -> Refer to the file @InstructionsForInternToIntern.md 
3. Official to Partner -> Refer to the file @InstructionsForOfficialToPartner.md 

So, based on this requirement, can you please update the whole plan so that we can have these types of interaction prioritising Official TO Institution i.e. @InstructionsForOfficialToInstitution.md  . Based on that,. please update the whole @YieldFi-Ai-Agent-Implementation.md ensuring that the whole plan is properly in order so that I could build these stuff much easier. Also, in all the steps, add a field i.e. "Summary of what happened in this step" corresponding to each step, which will be updated when this step is completed and the agent moves to the next step of this @YieldFi-Ai-Agent-Implementation.md plan.

I WANT to generate rules for this whole project so that I could build this project much easier. Please generate rules for this whole project. Here are the things that I want you to follow whenever you are generating the klist of rules
- Generate relevant rules for the whole project considering all the files like @YieldFi-Ai-Agent-Implementation.md  , @Yield-Fi-AI-Agent-Roadmap.md , @InstructionsForOfficialToInstitution.md , @InstructionsForInternToIntern.md , @InstructionsForOfficialToPartner.md 
- Whenever we update the code then we will update the README.md file so that we could have a record of what all changes were made and what all features are added.
- Wheneever we are done with the conversation with the user, then you will update the detailed summary of the conversation in the file @rough/all-conversations.md with the name of the chat title of the conversation and date timestamep of the conversation.
- Since we are building MVP for this project, so we will try to add features in a way that we could have a working product ASAP. So, even if we are adding some features or going for a new architectures or something, we would prefer minimal changes to the existing code.
- Always write the code in a documented way so that it could be easily understood by the user.
- In all the code files (except json files - you should not change the json files), you should add the a summary of the file.
 - what it does? 
 - why it is needed?
 - how it is used?
 - yet to do TODOs
 - any other relevant information
- Whenever you are reading a file, you should first read the summary of the file and then if you feel relevant then you should read the file. To ensure that it is up to date, we will update the file whenever we have made significant changes to it
-   **Analyze First:** Carefully analyze the request. Identify the core objectives, potential ambiguities, and any missing information.
-   **Propose a Plan:** Before writing any code, present a clear, step-by-step plan outlining how you intend to fulfill the request. This plan should include:
    * The specific files you plan to create or modify.
    * A summary of the key changes or additions proposed for each file.
    * Any major functions, classes, or logic blocks you intend to implement or alter.
    * Any assumptions you are making based on my request.
-   **Ask for Clarification:** If the request is unclear or you need more information to proceed confidently, explicitly list the questions you have.
-   **Wait for Confirmation:** **Do not proceed with generating or modifying code.** Wait for me to explicitly confirm, modify, or reject the proposed plan (e.g., by me saying "Proceed with the plan", "Yes, looks good", or providing feedback).

- Only proceed with implementation *after* I have approved your plan. For very simple, single-file, unambiguous tasks, you may state that you are proceeding directly because the request is straightforward.
- Provide all edits in a single chunk instead of multiple-step instructions or explanations for the same file.
# Clean Code Guidelines

## Constants Over Magic Numbers
- Replace hard-coded values with named constants
- Use descriptive constant names that explain the value's purpose
- Keep constants at the top of the file or in a dedicated constants file

## Meaningful Names
- Variables, functions, and classes should reveal their purpose
- Names should explain why something exists and how it's used
- Avoid abbreviations unless they're universally understood

## Smart Comments
- Don't comment on what the code does - make the code self-documenting
- Use comments to explain why something is done a certain way
- Document APIs, complex algorithms, and non-obvious side effects

## Single Responsibility
- Each function should do exactly one thing
- Functions should be small and focused
- If a function needs a comment to explain what it does, it should be split

## DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Extract repeated code into reusable functions
- Share common logic through proper abstraction
- Maintain single sources of truth

## Clean Structure
- Keep related code together
- Organize code in a logical hierarchy
- Use consistent file and folder naming conventions

## Encapsulation
- Hide implementation details
- Expose clear interfaces
- Move nested conditionals into well-named functions

## Code Quality Maintenance
- Refactor continuously
- Fix technical debt early
- Leave code cleaner than you found it

## Testing
- Write tests before fixing bugs
- Keep tests readable and maintainable
- Test edge cases and error conditions

## Version Control
- Write clear commit messages
- Make small, focused commits
- Use meaningful branch names
