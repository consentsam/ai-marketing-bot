    *   Created `.gitignore`.
    *   Updated `requirements.txt` with initial dependencies (`python-dotenv`, `pyyaml`, `streamlit`), noting some pre-existing content.
    *   Created `__init__.py` files in `src/` and subdirectories.
    *   User was instructed to manually create `.env.example` due to tool limitations.
    *   User troubleshooting for `streamlit command not found` and `src/app.py not found` (related to virtual environment and ensuring `app.py` exists before running).
*   **User Approval:** Received for Step 1.

**Chat Summary: Define Core Data Models - Step 2**
*   **Date:** 2025-05-07 HH:MM
*   **Focus:** Completion of Step 2: Define core data models.
*   **Key Decisions/Outputs:**
    *   Validated pre-existing data models in `src/models/account.py`, `src/models/tweet.py`, and `src/models/response.py` against Step 2 requirements.
    *   The models (`AccountType`, `Account`, `TweetMetadata`, `Tweet`, `ResponseType`, `AIResponse`) were found to largely meet or exceed requirements, including `from_dict`/`to_dict` methods and docstrings.
    *   Pre-existing additional fields and enum members were noted and preserved under the minimal disruption rule.
    *   Changelog entries were added to each model file.
    *   `src/models/__init__.py` was updated to correctly expose `ResponseType`.
*   **User Approval:** Received for Step 2.
