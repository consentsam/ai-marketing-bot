# Changelog:
# 2025-05-07 HH:MM - Step 7 - Initial implementation of prompt engineering for dynamic tweet interactions.

"""
Prompt engineering for the YieldFi AI Agent.

Purpose: Constructs dynamic and contextually relevant prompts for the AI model (e.g., xAI)
         to generate appropriate responses for various social media interactions.
Rationale: Effective prompts are crucial for guiding the LLM to produce outputs that
           align with YieldFi's branding, tone, and specific interaction goals. This module
           encapsulates the logic for creating these prompts based on diverse input factors.
Usage: Called by the `response_generator` module. It takes interaction context
       (like original post, account types, knowledge snippets) and returns a formatted prompt string.
TODOs:
    - Fully implement prompt variations based on all scenarios in Instructions*.md files.
    - Integrate dynamic example loading if hardcoded examples become too numerous.
    - Add prompt generation logic for other platforms (Discord, Telegram) and tasks (news widget).
