YieldFi: On-Chain Asset Management Platform
What is YieldFi?
YieldFi is the first fully on-chain asset management platform designed as a fund of funds for DeFi, combining institutional rigor with blockchain transparency. It strategically allocates funds across blue-chip DeFi protocols to create optimized yield index products.
Key Benefits
Curated Yield Indexes – Products optimized for different risk profiles
High Returns – Aggregated yield across top DeFi protocols
Full Transparency – Verifiable proof of reserves and yield
Liquidity – Assets can be redeemed anytime (8-day cooling period)
Cross-Chain Support – Works across major L1s and L2s
Problem Solved
DeFi's rapid growth created complexity that makes it difficult for average investors to:
Navigate fragmented opportunities across hundreds of chains and protocols
Manage constantly changing variable yields
Handle fluctuating liquidity and market depth
Access institutional-level deals and incentives
Conduct proper due diligence on protocols
How It Works
Deposit & Tokenization – Users receive yield index tokens (ERC-4626/ERC-20)
Secure Custody – Assets stored in multi-sig wallets (3/5 signers)
Automated Deployment – Assets allocated to blue-chip DeFi protocols
Daily Distributions – Returns pooled and settled daily
Continuous Optimization – 24/7 monitoring for optimal returns
Security Approach
Smart contracts audited by Halborn, Spearbit/Cantina, SmartState
Assets stored in multi-sig wallets, not in smart contracts
Diversified deployment across trusted protocols
Delta-neutral strategies to eliminate directional risk
Products
YUSD
Dollar-pegged stablecoin with yield
Based on USDC with ERC4626 standard
Supports deposits in USDT, DAI, USDe, Pendle PT Tokens
Yield from lending platforms and delta-neutral strategies
YETH
Yield-bearing Ethereum asset
Based on WETH with ERC4626 standard
Supports stETH, rETH, ETHx, Pendle PT Tokens
Yield from staking, lending, and yield trading protocols
YBTC
Yield-generating Bitcoin asset
Based on WBTC with ERC4626 standard
Supports sBTC, tBTC, Pendle PT Tokens
Yield from lending markets and delta-neutral strategies
Technical Implementation
YTokens
Two implementations:
YToken (L1) - Full ERC4626 compliance with yield vesting
YTokenL2 - Streamlined for Layer 2 with oracle-based pricing
Yield Vesting Mechanism
Distributes yield gradually over 24 hours
Prevents yield sniping and exchange rate manipulation
Creates predictable, smooth value increases
Manager Contract
Allows deposits of various whitelisted tokens
Simplifies user experience with Receipt NFTs
Processes mint/redeem requests via off-chain keepers
User Journey
Minting
Select chain and connect wallet
Choose asset and approve transaction
Review and mint tokens
Redemption
