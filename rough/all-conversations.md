**Chat Summary: UI Implementation & API Key Stabilization (Steps 14-16)**
*   **Date:** 2025-05-07 HH:MM
*   **Focus:** Stabilizing API key loading, implementing basic Streamlit UI for tweet replies, and debugging related issues.
*   **Key Decisions/Outputs:**
    *   Resolved `XAI_API_KEY` loading issues by clarifying `.env` structure (e.g., `AI__XAI_API_KEY`) and ensuring `src/config/settings.py` correctly overrides YAML placeholders with environment variables.
    *   Updated `src/ai/xai_client.py` to use the correct xAI API endpoint (`/v1/chat/completions`) and payload structure.
    *   Modified `config.yaml` to reflect actual environment variable sourcing for API keys and added `xai_model`.
    *   Refactored `src/ui/tweet_input.py` to:
        *   Correctly handle tweet object creation from URL or manual input.
        *   Integrate `st.spinner` for loading indication during AI calls.
        *   Implement robust UI error display using `st.error()` for `APIError` and other exceptions.
        *   Add logger for better error tracking.
    *   Successfully generated AI replies in the Streamlit UI, confirming end-to-end functionality for the basic reply feature.
    *   Updated changelogs for `settings.py`, `xai_client.py`, `tweet_input.py`, and `config.yaml`.
*   **User Approval:** Implicitly approved by proceeding and seeing successful reply generation.
*   **Step Status:** Steps 14 (Basic Streamlit app), 15 (Tweet input interface), and 16 (Response visualization) are now considered complete and documented in `YieldFi-Ai-Agent-Implementation.md`.

*   **Key Decisions/Outputs:**
    *   Modified `src/ai/prompt_engineering.py` to include the `generate_new_tweet_prompt` function. This function takes a `TweetCategory` object, `Account` (for persona), an optional `topic`, optional `yieldfi_knowledge_snippet`, and `platform` to generate tailored prompts for new tweet creation.
    *   The prompt construction logic leverages category details (description, keywords, style guidelines) and integrates them with the active account's persona and YieldFi's core messaging.
    *   The `__main__` block in `prompt_engineering.py` was updated with examples for testing `generate_new_tweet_prompt`.
    *   Updated `src/ai/__init__.py` to export the new `generate_new_tweet_prompt` function.
    *   Addressed and resolved syntax errors identified during the implementation.
*   **User Approval:** Received for Step 18.

## Chat Session: 2025-05-08 (Approx. 00:30 - 02:00 UTC)

**Focus:** Debugging and Enhancing "Create New Tweet by Category" Feature (Steps 18 & 19)

**Key Activities & Resolutions:**

1.  **Initial `TypeError` in `copy_button` (Step 19 UI):**
    *   **Issue:** `copy_button()` in `src/ui/category_select.py` was called with an unexpected `key_suffix` argument.
    *   **Resolution:** Inspected `src/ui/components.py` to confirm `copy_button` definition, then removed the `key_suffix` argument from the call in `src/ui/category_select.py`.

2.  **Enhanced Logging System (Project-wide impact):**
    *   **Request:** User asked for more detailed, timestamped logs saved to a `logs` directory.
    *   **Changes in `src/utils/logging.py`:**
        *   Ensured `logs/` directory creation.
        *   Implemented timestamped log filenames (e.g., `log-YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.log`).
        *   Updated log formatter for more detail: `%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(module)s:%(lineno)d - %(message)s`.
        *   Added `console_level` configuration to `config.yaml` and respective handling in `logging.py`.
    *   **Changes in `src/ui/category_select.py`:** Added extensive `logger.debug`, `logger.info`, and `logger.error` calls.
    *   **Changes in `config.yaml`:** Added `logging.show_raw_response_in_ui: true` (and logic in UI to use it) and `logging.console_level`.

3.  **`ImportError` for `TWEET_CATEGORIES` (Step 19 UI):**
    *   **Issue:** `src/ui/category_select.py` was trying to import `TWEET_CATEGORIES` from `src/ai/prompt_engineering.py`, which no longer exists there (categories are loaded from JSON as per Step 17).
    *   **Resolution:**
        *   Removed the incorrect import.
        *   Ensured `src/ui/category_select.py` correctly uses `load_tweet_categories()` (which loads from `data/input/categories.json`) and `TweetCategory` objects throughout its logic.
        *   Updated `DATA_CATEGORIES_PATH` in `category_select.py` to use `get_config` for flexibility.

4.  **`AttributeError: 'AIResponse' object has no attribute 'reply'` (Step 19 UI):**
    *   **Issue:** `src/ui/category_select.py` was attempting to access `response.reply` and `response.raw_response` on the `AIResponse` object, but the correct attribute for content is `content`, and raw response isn't directly exposed that way.
    *   **Resolution:** Updated `src/ui/category_select.py` to use `response.content` for the tweet text and `response.to_dict()` in debug logs for full response details.

5.  **Missing Tone Display ("AI Suggested Tone: N/A") (Step 19 UI / Step 18 Logic):**
    *   **Issue:** The tone for newly generated tweets was always N/A because `AIResponse.tone` was hardcoded to `None` in `src/ai/response_generator.py` for the `generate_new_tweet` function.
    *   **Resolution (in `src/ai/response_generator.py` for `generate_new_tweet`):**
        *   Imported `analyze_tone` from `src/ai/tone_analyzer.py`.
        *   After generating tweet content, `analyze_tone` is called on this content.
        *   The `AIResponse.tone` field is now populated with the result of this analysis.
        *   Updated type hint for `category` parameter to `TweetCategory`.

6.  **Improved Tweet Visibility in UI (Step 19 UI Enhancement):**
    *   **Issue:** The previously green background for displayed tweets in `src/ui/category_select.py` made text hard to read.
    *   **Resolution:** Updated the CSS in the `st.markdown` call to use a light gray background (`#f9f9f9`), dark gray text (`#333333`), a softer border, and slightly larger font size with better line height for improved readability.

**Outcome:**
*   The "Create New Tweet by Category" feature is now functioning correctly, displaying the generated tweet and its analyzed tone.
*   Logging is significantly enhanced across the relevant modules.
*   UI visibility for the generated tweet is improved.
*   Steps 18 and 19 in `data/docs/YieldFi-Ai-Agent-Implementation.md` have been marked as complete with detailed summaries.
