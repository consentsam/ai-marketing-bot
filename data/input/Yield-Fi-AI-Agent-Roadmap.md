### 1. **Social Media Automation**

Automates the process of crafting Twitter replies by suggesting context-aware responses based on the active account (Official or Intern), the type of account being interacted with (Partner, Big Account, KOLs), style (tone, examples, goals, etc..) suggestions for the type of interactions and current YieldFi ecosystem knowledge data. 

**Inputs:**

- **Data:** Tweet content, account type (Official or Intern), sender account type (Partner, Big Account, Partner Intern, KOL), current YieldFi ecosystem updates (e.g., new pools, yield strategies - current metrics be fetched from live page urls + working logic from whitepaper), style (tone, examples, goals, etc..)
- **Source:** Twitter API (tweets), YieldFi internal ecosystem updates (website, social media channels, etc.).

**Thinking:**

- The system should determine the context of the tweet (replying to a partner, an official announcement, or a casual interaction). Based on the active account (official or intern), it will stitch a response using pre-set templates and style recommendations (professional for partners, casual for community, etc.).
- It will use natural language processing (NLP) to understand the tone, sentiment, and information from the original tweet to suggest appropriate replies based on yieldfi product context.

**Output:**

- **Data:** Context-aware reply suggestions, customized for the active account and the type of interaction.

- **Destination:** Browser extension/TG bot anything is fine, can it be directly posted through automation?
