## Chat Session: Date Unknown (Inferred Completion of Step 5)
**Focus:** Step 5: Define configuration system
**Key Decisions & Outputs (Inferred from code):**
*   Implemented `src/config/settings.py` for loading configurations from `config.yaml` and environment variables.
*   `load_config()` function loads YAML first, then `.env`, then direct OS environment variables.
*   `get_config(key, default)` allows dot-notation access to nested values, case-insensitively.
*   Type conversion for env vars (bool, int, float) seems to be handled.
*   `config.yaml` was likely created/updated for default values.
*   Unit tests in `tests/config/test_settings.py` were likely created.
**Step Status:** Marked as Completed & Approved in `YieldFi-Ai-Agent-Implementation.md` (Inferred).

## Chat Session: Date Unknown (Inferred Completion of Step 6)
**Focus:** Step 6: Create xAI API client
**Key Decisions & Outputs (Inferred from code):**
*   Implemented `src/ai/xai_client.py` with an `XAIClient` class.
*   `XAIClient` includes `get_completion` method to interact with an AI API (mocked xAI, with Google PaLM fallback logic).
*   Handles API key loading from the configuration system (Step 5).
*   Uses `requests` for underlying API calls.
*   Includes error handling for API responses (raising `APIError`).
*   `src/ai/__init__.py` likely updated to export `XAIClient`.
*   Unit tests in `tests/ai/test_xai_client.py` were likely created, mocking external calls.
**Step Status:** Marked as Completed & Approved in `YieldFi-Ai-Agent-Implementation.md` (Inferred).

## Chat Session: 2025-05-07 HH:MM (Approx. 19:40 UTC)
**Focus:** Step 8: Develop tone analysis module
**Key Decisions & Outputs:**
*   Implemented `src/ai/tone_analyzer.py` with `analyze_tone` and `analyze_tweet_tone` functions.
    *   `analyze_tone` uses TextBlob for sentiment (positive, negative, neutral), score, subjectivity, confidence. Placeholders for XAI/Palm.
    *   `analyze_tweet_tone` updates Tweet objects.
*   Updated `src/ai/__init__.py` to export new tone analysis functions and ensure prompt engineering helpers were also exported.
*   Created `tests/ai/test_tone_analyzer.py` with 11 unit tests covering various scenarios, including TextBlob analysis, method selection, and error handling. All tests passed after removing one test case that conflicted with `Tweet` model validation (disallowing empty content).
*   User approved the changes.
**Step Status:** Completed and documented in `YieldFi-Ai-Agent-Implementation.md`.

## Chat Session: 2025-05-07 HH:MM (Approx. 19:55 UTC)
**Focus:** Step 9: Implement response generator & Conclude AI Integration Section
**Key Decisions & Outputs:**
*   Confirmed/Updated Steps 5 & 6 (Config System, XAI Client) as complete in `YieldFi-Ai-Agent-Implementation.md` with inferred summaries based on existing code.
*   Implemented `src/ai/response_generator.py` with `generate_tweet_reply` and `generate_new_tweet`.
    *   Orchestrates calls to tone analysis (Step 8), prompt engineering (Step 7), XAI client (Step 6).
    *   Knowledge retrieval (Step 11) is mocked using an internal `MockKnowledgeRetriever`.
    *   Handles AI response parsing and errors; returns `AIResponse` objects.
    *   Corrected `AIResponse` field mapping for `responding_as`, `target_account`, and `generation_time` after initial test failures.
*   Updated `src/ai/__init__.py` to export new response generator functions.
*   Created `tests/ai/test_response_generator.py` with 6 unit tests, mocking dependencies. All tests pass.
*   User approved Step 9 completion.
**Step Status:** Completed and documented in `YieldFi-Ai-Agent-Implementation.md`.
**Section Status:** "AI Integration" (Steps 5-9) is now considered complete.

**Chat Summary: UI Implementation & API Key Stabilization (Steps 14-16)**
*   **Date:** 2025-05-07 HH:MM
*   **Focus:** Stabilizing API key loading, implementing basic Streamlit UI for tweet replies, and debugging related issues.
*   **Key Decisions/Outputs:**
    *   Resolved `XAI_API_KEY` loading issues by clarifying `.env` structure (e.g., `AI__XAI_API_KEY`) and ensuring `src/config/settings.py` correctly overrides YAML placeholders with environment variables.
    *   Updated `src/ai/xai_client.py` to use the correct xAI API endpoint (`/v1/chat/completions`) and payload structure.
    *   Modified `config.yaml` to reflect actual environment variable sourcing for API keys and added `xai_model`.
    *   Refactored `src/ui/tweet_input.py` to:
        *   Correctly handle tweet object creation from URL or manual input.
        *   Integrate `st.spinner` for loading indication during AI calls.
        *   Implement robust UI error display using `st.error()` for `APIError` and other exceptions.
        *   Add logger for better error tracking.
    *   Successfully generated AI replies in the Streamlit UI, confirming end-to-end functionality for the basic reply feature.
    *   Updated changelogs for `settings.py`, `xai_client.py`, `tweet_input.py`, and `config.yaml`.
*   **User Approval:** Implicitly approved by proceeding and seeing successful reply generation.
*   **Step Status:** Steps 14 (Basic Streamlit app), 15 (Tweet input interface), and 16 (Response visualization) are now considered complete and documented in `YieldFi-Ai-Agent-Implementation.md`.
