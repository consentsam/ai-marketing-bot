My response on the first response:

My thoughts :
> Twitter API access (tweepy or python-twitter-v2), xAI API integration (assuming an SDK or REST API is available), and other utilities like requests for HTTP calls.
This should actually be a source which would give the content of the tweet and the metadata associated with it. Why this change? Because right now I haven't thought how I would go about reading tweets, so for now I want it to design in such a way that you are able to add other sources of tweet. By doing this, by defining or configuring with a file or two, the project will be setup for other sources of tweet. So, find a good data structure with relevant fields so that integrating a new data source is possible or easy. For start - I might just provide you some tweet content and relevant metadata so that you are able to make decisions as you would be if you were reading live with Twitter APIs, so that later integration with Twitter APIs is simple as it contains the same input datastructure (with non-relevant fields values set to be null)

Also, I want you to prepare a detailed step by step plan keeping these things in mind

When creating your plan, follow these guidelines:

1. Start with the core project structure and essential configurations.
2. Progress through database schema, server actions, and API routes.
4. Break down the implementation of individual pages and features into smaller, focused steps.
5. Include steps for integrating authentication, authorization, and third-party services.
6. Incorporate steps for implementing client-side interactivity and state management.
7. Include steps for writing tests and implementing the specified testing strategy.
8. Ensure that each step builds upon the previous ones in a logical manner.

Present your plan using the following markdown-based format. This format is specifically designed to integrate with the subsequent code generation phase, where an AI will systematically implement each step and mark it as complete. Each step must be atomic and self-contained enough to be implemented in a single code generation iteration, and should modify no more than 20 files at once (ideally less) to ensure manageable changes. Make sure to include any instructions the user should follow for things you can't do like installing libraries, updating configurations on services, etc (Ex: Running a SQL script for storage bucket RLS policies in the Supabase editor).

# Implementation Plan

## [Section Name]
- [ ] Step 1: [Brief title]
  - **Task**: [Detailed explanation of what needs to be implemented]
  - **Files**: [Maximum of 20 files, ideally less]
    - `path/to/file1.ts`: [Description of changes]
  - **Step Dependencies**: [Step Dependencies]
  - **User Instructions**: [Instructions for User]

[Additional steps...]
After presenting your plan, provide a brief summary of the overall approach and any key considerations for the implementation process.

Remember to:

Ensure that your plan covers all aspects of the technical specification.
Break down complex features into smaller, manageable tasks.
Consider the logical order of implementation, ensuring that dependencies are addressed in the correct sequence.
Include steps for error handling, data validation, and edge case management.
Begin your response with your brainstorming, then proceed to the creation your detailed implementation plan for the web application based on the provided specification.

Once you are done, we will pass this specification to the AI code generation system.


Please update that in the file @Ethena-Ai-Agent-Implementation.md .  Also, ensure that if you are reading a markdown file in this project then you have to summarise that file starting of that file. 

Here are the relevant files @docs.ethena.fi.md contains the docs of Ethena. @Ethena-AI-Agent-Roadmap.md  contains the requirements or implementation plan given by CTO. Please be as much descriptive as you can be. Do a detailed analysis of the files and then update the plan.



-----------


So, as mentioned in the @Ethena-AI-Agent-Roadmap.md , there would be three types of interaction i.e. 
1. Official To Institution -> Refer to the file @InstructionsForOfficialToInstitution.md 
2. Intern to Intern -> Refer to the file @InstructionsForInternToIntern.md 
3. Official to Partner -> Refer to the file @InstructionsForOfficialToPartner.md 

So, based on this requirement, can you please update the whole plan so that we can have these types of interaction prioritising Official TO Institution i.e. @InstructionsForOfficialToInstitution.md  . Based on that,. please update the whole @Ethena-Ai-Agent-Implementation.md ensuring that the whole plan is properly in order so that I could build these stuff much easier. Also, in all the steps, add a field i.e. "Summary of what happened in this step" corresponding to each step, which will be updated when this step is completed and the agent moves to the next step of this @Ethena-Ai-Agent-Implementation.md plan.



-----


I WANT to generate rules for this whole project so that I could build this project much easier. Please generate rules for this whole project. Here are the things that I want you to follow whenever you are generating the klist of rules
- Generate relevant rules for the whole project considering all the files like @Ethena-Ai-Agent-Implementation.md  , @Ethena-AI-Agent-Roadmap.md , @InstructionsForOfficialToInstitution.md , @InstructionsForInternToIntern.md , @InstructionsForOfficialToPartner.md 
- Whenever we update the code then we will update the README.md file so that we could have a record of what all changes were made and what all features are added.
- Wheneever we are done with the conversation with the user, then you will update the detailed summary of the conversation in the file @rough/all-conversations.md with the name of the chat title of the conversation and date timestamep of the conversation.
- Since we are building MVP for this project, so we will try to add features in a way that we could have a working product ASAP. So, even if we are adding some features or going for a new architectures or something, we would prefer minimal changes to the existing code.
- Always write the code in a documented way so that it could be easily understood by the user.
- In all the code files (except json files - you should not change the json files), you should add the a summary of the file.
 - what it does? 
 - why it is needed?
 - how it is used?
 - yet to do TODOs
 - any other relevant information
- Whenever you are reading a file, you should first read the summary of the file and then if you feel relevant then you should read the file. To ensure that it is up to date, we will update the file whenever we have made significant changes to it
-   **Analyze First:** Carefully analyze the request. Identify the core objectives, potential ambiguities, and any missing information.
-   **Propose a Plan:** Before writing any code, present a clear, step-by-step plan outlining how you intend to fulfill the request. This plan should include:
    * The specific files you plan to create or modify.
    * A summary of the key changes or additions proposed for each file.
    * Any major functions, classes, or logic blocks you intend to implement or alter.
    * Any assumptions you are making based on my request.
-   **Ask for Clarification:** If the request is unclear or you need more information to proceed confidently, explicitly list the questions you have.
-   **Wait for Confirmation:** **Do not proceed with generating or modifying code.** Wait for me to explicitly confirm, modify, or reject the proposed plan (e.g., by me saying "Proceed with the plan", "Yes, looks good", or providing feedback).

- Only proceed with implementation *after* I have approved your plan. For very simple, single-file, unambiguous tasks, you may state that you are proceeding directly because the request is straightforward.
- Provide all edits in a single chunk instead of multiple-step instructions or explanations for the same file.
# Clean Code Guidelines

## Constants Over Magic Numbers
- Replace hard-coded values with named constants
- Use descriptive constant names that explain the value's purpose
- Keep constants at the top of the file or in a dedicated constants file

## Meaningful Names
- Variables, functions, and classes should reveal their purpose
- Names should explain why something exists and how it's used
- Avoid abbreviations unless they're universally understood

## Smart Comments
- Don't comment on what the code does - make the code self-documenting
- Use comments to explain why something is done a certain way
- Document APIs, complex algorithms, and non-obvious side effects

## Single Responsibility
- Each function should do exactly one thing
- Functions should be small and focused
- If a function needs a comment to explain what it does, it should be split

## DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Extract repeated code into reusable functions
- Share common logic through proper abstraction
- Maintain single sources of truth

## Clean Structure
- Keep related code together
- Organize code in a logical hierarchy
- Use consistent file and folder naming conventions

## Encapsulation
- Hide implementation details
- Expose clear interfaces
- Move nested conditionals into well-named functions

## Code Quality Maintenance
- Refactor continuously
- Fix technical debt early
- Leave code cleaner than you found it

## Testing
- Write tests before fixing bugs
- Keep tests readable and maintainable
- Test edge cases and error conditions

## Version Control
- Write clear commit messages
- Make small, focused commits
- Use meaningful branch names

<PROMPT>

Understand the following context describing an existing Python-based LLM Marketing Assistant project built with Streamlit:

{{repo_context}}
Project: LLM-Driven Marketing Assistant (Ethena AI Agent)

Core Goal: Generate context-aware Twitter replies and new tweets using an AI model (like xAI), adapting to different personas (Official, Intern) and target audiences.

Technology: Python backend, Streamlit frontend, YAML/`.env` for configuration.

Key Modules & Functionality:

1.  `src/config` (`settings.py`, `config.yaml`, `.env`):
    * Purpose: Load and manage application configuration (API keys, logging levels, feature flags, AI provider details).
    * Functionality: Loads from `config.yaml`, overrides with `.env`, then OS environment variables. Provides `get_config()` function for access.

2.  `src/models` (`account.py`, `tweet.py`, `response.py`, `category.py`):
    * Purpose: Define core data structures using Python dataclasses.
    * Key Models:
        * `Account`: Represents social media accounts (ID, username, `AccountType` enum [OFFICIAL, INTERN, PARTNER, etc.], platform, metrics).
        * `Tweet`: Represents tweet content and `TweetMetadata` (ID, author, timestamps, engagement). Includes fields for analysis results (tone, sentiment).
        * `AIResponse`: Represents the AI's generated output (content, `ResponseType` enum, model used, context, tone).
        * `TweetCategory`: Defines categories for new tweet generation (name, description, keywords, style guidelines). Loaded from JSON.

3.  `src/data_sources` (`base.py`, `mock.py`, `twitter.py`, `twitter_auth.py`):
    * Purpose: Abstract and implement access to tweet/account data.
    * Key Components:
        * `TweetDataSource` (ABC): Interface defining methods like `get_tweet_by_id`, `get_account_by_username`, `post_tweet`.
        * `MockTweetDataSource`: Implements the interface using local JSON files (`sample_tweets.json`, `sample_accounts.json`) for testing/development.
        * `twitter.py`, `twitter_auth.py`: Placeholders/skeletons for future live Twitter API v2 integration using Tweepy (authentication handled separately).

4.  `src/knowledge` (`base.py`, `ethena.py`, `retrieval.py`):
    * Purpose: Manage and retrieve protocol-specific knowledge.
    * Key Components:
        * `KnowledgeSource` (ABC): Interface defining `search(query)` method.
        * `StaticJSONKnowledgeSource`: Implements interface using a structured JSON file (`ethena_knowledge.json`).
        * `EthenaDocsKnowledgeSource`: Implements interface using a Markdown file (`docs.ethena.fi.md`), performing basic text search.
        * `KnowledgeRetriever`: Aggregates results from multiple sources and formats them for prompts.

5.  `src/ai` (`xai_client.py`, `prompt_engineering.py`, `tone_analyzer.py`, `response_generator.py`):
    * Purpose: Handle AI model interaction, prompt creation, and response processing.
    * Key Components:
        * `XAIClient`: Wrapper for the primary LLM API (currently xAI, with Google PaLM fallback). Handles API key management, request formatting, and error handling (`APIError`).
        * `prompt_engineering.py`: Dynamically constructs detailed prompts based on context (original tweet, active/target accounts, knowledge, interaction guidelines from `InstructionsFor*.md`, category details).
        * `tone_analyzer.py`: Analyzes text sentiment (using TextBlob currently, placeholders for AI methods).
        * `response_generator.py`: Orchestrates the AI workflow. Takes input (tweet/category), calls tone analysis, knowledge retrieval (mocked), prompt engineering, and `XAIClient` to produce an `AIResponse`.

6.  `src/ui` (`components.py`, `tweet_input.py`, `category_select.py`):
    * Purpose: Define Streamlit UI components.
    * Functionality: Provides UI for selecting persona, inputting tweet URL/content or category/topic, triggering generation, and displaying the `AIResponse` (content, tone, copy button).

7.  `src/utils` (`logging.py`, `error_handling.py`):
    * Purpose: Provide shared utilities.
    * Functionality: Configurable logging setup (`logging.py`) and custom `APIError` exception with handling decorator (`error_handling.py`).

8.  `app.py`:
    * Purpose: Main entry point for the Streamlit application.
    * Functionality: Sets up page config, sidebar for persona selection, main area for selecting interaction type (Reply vs. New Tweet by Category), and calls relevant UI functions from `src/ui`.

9.  `data/` (`docs/`, `input/`):
    * `docs/`: Contains documentation and core guideline files.
        * `InstructionsFor*.md` (e.g., `InstructionsForOfficialToPartner.md`): These files define specific interaction styles, tones, example phrases, and goals for different persona pairings (e.g., how the 'Official' persona should reply to a 'Partner'). They guide the prompt engineering module. (Approx. 250 chars)
        * `Ethena-AI-Agent-Roadmap.md`: Outlines the high-level project goals, feature requirements (like social media automation, community engagement), and intended inputs/outputs for different agent capabilities, as defined by the project owner/CTO. (Approx. 230 chars)
        * `Ethena-Ai-Agent-Implementation.md`: Provides the detailed, step-by-step technical plan used by the development team/AI to build the application. It breaks down features into granular tasks, specifies file changes, dependencies, and completion status. (Approx. 250 chars)
        * `docs.ethena.fi.md`: Contains the primary, long-form documentation or whitepaper content for the Ethena protocol itself. This serves as a core knowledge source for the `EthenaDocsKnowledgeSource` to ground AI responses in factual information about the protocol. (Approx. 260 chars)
        * `ethena_knowledge.json`: Stores structured, easily queryable facts about Ethena, such as product details (name, APY, TVL), frequently asked questions (FAQs) with answers, key metrics, and security information. Used by `StaticJSONKnowledgeSource`. (Approx. 240 chars)
    * `input/`: Contains data used primarily by the mock data source and configuration systems.
        * `sample_tweets.json` / `sample_accounts.json`: Provide realistic example data structures and content for tweets and user accounts. Used by `MockTweetDataSource` for development and testing without requiring live API access. Crucial for simulating different interaction scenarios. (Approx. 260 chars)
        * `categories.json`: Defines the available categories for the "New Tweet by Category" feature. Each entry includes the category name, a description of its purpose, relevant keywords for prompting, and specific style guidelines (tone, length, hashtags) for the AI. (Approx. 260 chars)

10. `tests/`: Contains unit tests (using pytest) for various modules, mocking external dependencies.

Current State: Core logic for mock data interaction, AI response generation (reply & category-based), and Streamlit UI is implemented. Live Twitter integration is pending. Knowledge base uses static files. Testing framework exists.
{{repo_context}}

---

Based *only* on the `{{repo_context}}` provided above, create a detailed, step-by-step implementation plan to integrate the following new features into the existing project structure:

1.  **Image Generation:**
    * Add an option in the UI (for both replies and new tweets) to optionally generate a relevant poster image alongside the text.
    * If selected, the backend should generate an image relevant to the tweet content/topic . Here we will be using twitter APIs of twitter's image generation API by "grok-2-image" generation model.
    * Use the generated image link and store that in the database but if the image link will not be available for long time then Upload the generated image to cloud storage - you can make use of free image hosting APIs to store the images.
    * Return the public URL of the uploaded image as part of the `AIResponse`.
    * Display the generated image and its URL in the Streamlit UI.

2.  **Interaction Modes & Improved Prompts:**
    * Introduce distinct interaction "Modes" (e.g., "Default", "Professional", "Degen") selectable in the UI. Why we want this feature? - Because we want to have different prompts for different modes. For example, if we are in "Degen" mode then we will tweet in a differnt tone and using different lingo like - in degen mode, we normally talk using the word "ser", "gm-gm", "my intern did this and did that" etc.
    * Each mode should have its own configurable system prompt and potentially specific instructions that will be read from the Instructions files.
    * Modify the prompt engineering module to incorporate the selected mode's system prompt and instructions. So, basically there will be different files which would be named after the mode. For example - "InstructionsForDegen.md" and "InstructionsForProfessional.md". This all will be contained at the path - "data/protocols/{{protocol-name}}/mode-instructions/InstructionsFor*.md". This will be used to generate the prompt for the selected mode.
    * Define these modes in a structured way (e.g., JSON) that can be loaded per protocol. Focus on improving the "Degen" mode prompt specifically, but allow for improvement across all modes.

3.  **Relevancy Fact Generation:**
    * Modify the AI prompting and response based on the different metadata like. when was that tweet posted. For example, if the tweet is old then it would use it like it has happened already and so on. Like - if we could be talking about a tweet which would request users to invite to a Twitter Spaces event and then if the content of tweet/post is before that event then we will never say it as it has already happened. So, here if we are inviting them then we would speak in persusive way to come and invite us but if the post that is going to be post after the Twitter Spaces event then we would speak in a conclusive way and thank them for that. SO, considering this fact, we should always remember to include data like these so that we can generate more relevant tweets based on analysing these metadata.
    * One more example could be - if we are preparing a tweet after something very bad has happened and that has decreased the crypto market greed index significantly then in this case - relevancy fact is - "bearish-sentiment", "black-crypto-market", "crypto-market-down", "crypto-market-bearish", "crypto-market-down-20-percent" etc. Similarly, we will need to generate these sentiment and trend from the twitter APIs maybe but for now, let's have a list of relevancy facts which would be configurable for now but later it could come from different sources like - twitter APis, google trends, custom APIs, etc

4.  **Protocol Templatization:**
    * Refactor the configuration and data loading mechanisms to support multiple protocols (e.g., Ethena, Exana). so that all the data provided by the protocol could just live inside the repository (or better a pointer to a repository - OPTIONAL FEATURE) and be used to generate the relevant tweet based on the original tweet [IN CASE OF REPLIES] and generate the new tweet based on the category [IN CASE OF NEW TWEETS].
    * Introduce a way to set  `DEFAULT_PROTOCOL` to generate the tweets relevant to that protocol as the data for these protocols have to have at the path `/data/protocols/{{protocol-name}}/` 
    * Restructure data directories (knowledge files, categories, instructions, modes) into protocol-specific subdirectories (e.g., `data/protocols/ethena/`, `data/protocols/ethena/`).
    * Update relevant code modules to load data based on the `DEFAULT_PROTOCOL`.

5.  **Ethena Protocol Protocol Example:**
    * Create the necessary directory structure and placeholder data files (`categories.json`, `knowledge.json`, `mode-instructions/mode1.json`, `mode-instructions/mode2.json`, `mode-instructions/mode3.json`, `docs.md`) for a new protocol named "Ethena" under `data/protocols/`. This serves as a demonstration of the templatization.

**Plan Requirements:**

* Provide the plan in a step-by-step format.
* For each step, specify:
    * A brief **Task** description.
    * The **Files** to be created or modified.
    * Any **Step Dependencies** on previous steps (within this new plan or the existing structure).
    * Any **User Instructions** required (e.g., obtaining API keys, populating data files).
* Ensure the plan builds logically upon the existing architecture described in the context.
* Prioritize modularity and the goal of making the system easily adaptable for new protocols.
* Assume the existing codebase functions as described in the context.

# Ethena AI Agent Implementation Plan

This document outlines the detailed implementation plan for the Ethena AI Agent, focusing on creating a modular, scalable system for Twitter interaction and content generation using xAI APIs.

## Overview

The Ethena AI Agent aims to enhance Ethena's social media presence by automating and optimizing Twitter replies and content generation. This implementation focuses on creating a modular architecture that allows for different tweet data sources (starting with mock data, then live Twitter API), making future integration with other platforms (Discord, Telegram as per roadmap) and knowledge sources more streamlined.

## Core Architecture

- [x] **Step 1: Set up project structure and environment**
    -   **Task**: Create the base project directory structure as specified, initialize `git`, create initial `.gitignore`, `requirements.txt` (with essential libraries like `python-dotenv`, `pyyaml`, `streamlit`), and an initial `.env.example` file.
        -   **EXPLANATION**: A well-defined structure from the start makes it easier for the AI to locate files, understand module relationships, and generate code for the correct locations. Explicitly listing initial requirements helps in environment setup.
    -   **Key Considerations/Sub-Tasks**:
        * Create main directories: `src/`, `data/`, `data/docs`, `data/input`, `data/output`, `tests/`, `scripts/`, `.cursor/rules/`.
        * Create sub-directories within `src/`: `ai/`, `config/`, `data_sources/`, `knowledge/`, `models/`, `ui/`, `utils/`.
        * Create `__init__.py` files in `src/` and all its subdirectories to mark them as Python packages.
        * Populate `.env.example` with all anticipated API keys and configuration variables (e.g., `XAI_API_KEY`, `TWITTER_API_KEY`, `LOG_LEVEL`, `DATA_SOURCE_TYPE`).
        * Populate `requirements.txt` with initial core dependencies.
    -   **Files**:
        * `src/`
        * `src/config/`
        * `src/data_sources/`
        * `src/models/`
        * `src/ai/`
        * `src/utils/`
        * `src/knowledge/`
        * `src/ui/`
        * `src/evaluation/`
        * `src/analytics/`
        * `src/feedback/`
        * `data/docs/`
        * `data/input/`
        * `data/output/`
        * `tests/`
        * `.env.example`
        * `requirements.txt`
        * `.gitignore`
    -   **Step Dependencies**: None
    -   **User Instructions**: Clone the repository (if it exists, otherwise initialize git) and ensure Python 3.9+ is installed. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` after this step is complete to install initial dependencies.

---
**Step Completion Summary (2025-05-07 HH:MM):**
* **Status:** Completed & Approved by User
* **Files Modified/Created:**
    * `.gitignore`
    * `requirements.txt`
    * `src/__init__.py`
    * `src/ai/__init__.py`
    * `src/config/__init__.py`
    * `src/data_sources/__init__.py`
    * `src/knowledge/__init__.py`
    * `src/models/__init__.py`
    * `src/ui/__init__.py`
    * `src/utils/__init__.py`
    * `src/evaluation/__init__.py`
    * `src/analytics/__init__.py`
    * `src/feedback/__init__.py`
    * Directories created: `src/` (and subdirectories `ai`, `config`, `data_sources`, `knowledge`, `models`, `ui`, `utils`, `evaluation`, `analytics`, `feedback`), `data/` (and subdirectories `docs`, `input`, `output`), `tests/`, `scripts/`, `.cursor/rules/`.
* **Summary of Changes:**
    * `.gitignore`: Created with standard Python, IDE, and environment ignore patterns. Ensured `.env` is ignored and `!.env.example` is not.
    * `requirements.txt`: Updated to include `python-dotenv`, `pyyaml`, `streamlit`. Noted that the file pre-existed with other dependencies which were preserved.
    * `src/*/__init__.py` files: All specified `__init__.py` files were created or confirmed to exist, ensuring Python package structure. Some were noted to have pre-existing content.
    * Directories: The specified project directory structure was created using `mkdir -p`.
    * `.env.example`: User was instructed to create this file manually due to a "globalIgnore" tool restriction preventing its automated creation. The intended content for this file was provided to the user.
---

- [x] **Step 2: Define core data models**
    -   **Task**: Implement Python dataclasses for `Tweet`, `TweetMetadata`, `Account`, `AccountType` (Enum), and `AIResponse`, `ResponseType` (Enum) in their respective files within `src/models/`. These models should include all fields necessary for processing tweet data, representing user accounts, and structuring AI-generated responses, as informed by `sample_tweets.json`, `sample_accounts.json`, and the project roadmap. Include `from_dict` and `to_dict` methods for serialization/deserialization.
        -   **EXPLANATION**: Detailed data models guide the AI in understanding the structure of data it will work with, leading to more accurate code for data manipulation, storage, and API interactions. Specifying `from_dict`/`to_dict` standardizes data handling.
    -   **Key Considerations/Sub-Tasks**:
        * `AccountType` enum: Define all relevant types (OFFICIAL, INTERN, PARTNER, KOL, INSTITUTION, COMMUNITY_MEMBER, PARTNER_INTERN, COMPETITOR, UNKNOWN) with string values. Implement `from_string` classmethod.
        * `Account` dataclass: Include fields like `account_id`, `username`, `display_name`, `account_type` (using `AccountType`), `platform`, `follower_count`, `bio`, `interaction_history`, `tags`.
        * `TweetMetadata` dataclass: Include `tweet_id`, `created_at`, `source`, `author_id`, `author_username`, engagement metrics (`like_count`, etc.), context fields (`in_reply_to_tweet_id`).
        * `Tweet` dataclass: Include `content`, `metadata` (using `TweetMetadata`), and fields for analysis results like `tone`, `topics`, `sentiment_score`.
        * `ResponseType` enum: Define types like `TWEET_REPLY`, `NEW_TWEET`, `ANNOUNCEMENT`, `PRODUCT_UPDATE`, `COMMUNITY_UPDATE`, etc.
        * `AIResponse` dataclass: Include `content`, `response_type` (using `ResponseType`), `model_used`, `prompt_used`, `source_tweet_id`, `responding_as`, `target_account`, `tone`.
        * Ensure all models have comprehensive docstrings.
        * Create `src/models/__init__.py` to expose these models.
    -   **Files**:
        * `src/models/tweet.py`
        * `src/models/account.py`
        * `src/models/response.py`
        * `src/models/__init__.py`
    -   **Step Dependencies**: Step 1
    -   **User Instructions**: Review the implemented data models. Ensure they capture all necessary fields based on `sample_tweets.json`, `sample_accounts.json`, and the types of interactions planned in `data/docs/InstructionsFor*.md` and the roadmap.

- [x] **Step 3: Implement abstract data source interface**
    -   **Task**: Define an abstract base class `TweetDataSource` in `src/data_sources/base.py` with abstract methods for all data operations needed (e.g., `get_tweet_by_id`, `get_tweet_by_url`, `search_tweets`, `get_account_info`, `get_account_by_username`, `get_recent_tweets_by_account`, `post_tweet`). The methods should use the data models from Step 2 in their signatures.
        -   **EXPLANATION**: A clear contract for data sources ensures that any concrete implementation (mock, Twitter API, etc.) will be compatible with the rest of the system. Specifying method signatures with defined models aids the AI in generating compliant implementations.
    -   **Key Considerations/Sub-Tasks**:
        * Use `abc.ABC` and `abc.abstractmethod`.
        * Define methods clearly specifying expected arguments (types from `src/models`) and return types (types from `src/models`).
        * Include properties like `name` (str), `is_read_only` (bool), and `capabilities` (Dict[str, bool]).
        * Write a comprehensive docstring for the class and each abstract method.
    -   **Files**:
        * `src/data_sources/base.py`
        * `src/data_sources/__init__.py` (to export `TweetDataSource`)
    -   **Step Dependencies**: Step 2
    -   **User Instructions**: None.

* **Status:** Completed & Approved by User
* **Files Modified/Created:**
    * `src/data_sources/base.py`
    * `src/data_sources/__init__.py`
* **Summary of Changes:**
    * `src/data_sources/base.py`: Validated pre-existing `TweetDataSource` abstract base class. Confirmed all required abstract methods (using Step 2 models), properties, and docstrings were present and correctly defined. Added changelog entry.
    * `src/data_sources/__init__.py`: Confirmed pre-existing file correctly exports `TweetDataSource`. Updated changelog.
---

- [x] **Step 4: Implement mock tweet data source**
    -   **Task**: Create `MockTweetDataSource` in `src/data_sources/mock.py` that inherits from `TweetDataSource` and implements all abstract methods by reading from/writing to local JSON files (`data/input/sample_tweets.json`, `data/input/sample_accounts.json`).
        -   **EXPLANATION**: A functional mock allows early testing and development of dependent modules (AI logic, UI). Explicitly stating it should implement *all* methods ensures the AI doesn't miss any part of the interface.
    -   **Key Considerations/Sub-Tasks**:
        * Implement `_load_tweets` and `_load_accounts` to parse JSON data into the defined data models (Step 2). Handle potential file errors.
        * Implement `get_tweet_by_id`, `get_tweet_by_url` (including URL parsing to ID).
        * Implement `search_tweets` with basic case-insensitive string matching.
        * Implement `get_account_info` and `get_account_by_username`.
        * Implement `get_recent_tweets_by_account` (consider sorting by date).
        * Implement `post_tweet`: For mock, this can append to an in-memory list or print to console, returning a mock tweet ID.
        * Ensure data consistency (e.g., `author_id` in tweets refers to an existing account).
    -   **Files**:
        * `src/data_sources/mock.py`
        * `data/input/sample_tweets.json` (ensure it's populated)
        * `data/input/sample_accounts.json` (ensure it's populated)
    -   **Step Dependencies**: Step 3
    -   **User Instructions**: Populate `sample_tweets.json` and `sample_accounts.json` with diverse and representative data, including different account types and tweet scenarios, to facilitate thorough testing.

---

- [x] **Step 5: Define configuration system**
    -   **Task**: Implement `src/config/settings.py` to load configurations from `config.yaml` and environment variables (using `python-dotenv` and `os.environ`). Provide functions like `get_config(key, default)` and `load_config()`.
        -   **EXPLANATION**: Detailing the expected functions (`get_config`, `load_config`) and sources (YAML, .env) provides a clear target for implementation, ensuring all necessary config access patterns are covered.
    -   **Key Considerations/Sub-Tasks**:
        * `load_config()` should read `config.yaml` first, then override with environment variables.
        * `get_config()` should allow fetching nested values using dot notation (e.g., `ai.provider`).
        * Prioritize environment variables over `config.yaml` values.
        * Ensure `.env` is in `.gitignore`.
        * Define default values in `config.yaml` for non-sensitive settings.
        * Handle missing keys gracefully in `get_config` (return `default`).
    -   **Files**:
        * `src/config/settings.py`
        * `src/config/__init__.py` (to export config functions)
        * `config.yaml` (with default values)
        * Update `.gitignore` to include `.env`.
    -   **Step Dependencies**: Step 1
    -   **User Instructions**: Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example` and populate it with your actual API keys (placeholder for now if not available) and any environment-specific settings.

    * `config.yaml` (Created/Updated)
    * `.gitignore` (Ensured `.env` is present)
    * `tests/config/test_settings.py` (Likely Created)
* **Summary of Changes:**
    * `src/config/settings.py`: Implemented a robust configuration loading system. `load_config()` handles loading from `config.yaml`, then overrides with values from `.env` (via `python-dotenv`), and finally direct environment variables. `get_config(key_path, default)` allows case-insensitive dot-notation access to nested configuration values. Type conversion for boolean, integer, and float values from environment variables is handled. Changelog entries in the file indicate prior work.
    * `src/config/__init__.py`: Assumed to export necessary functions like `get_config`, `load_config`.
    * `config.yaml`: Assumed to be created with default application configurations.
    * `tests/config/test_settings.py`: Assumed to be created with unit tests for the configuration system.

## AI Integration

- [x] **Step 6: Create xAI API client**
    -   **Task**: Implement `XAIClient` in `src/ai/xai_client.py`. This class will handle all communication with the xAI API (or a fallback like Google PaLM as currently designed). Include methods for text generation (e.g., `get_completion`). Implement error handling and API key management using the config system from Step 5.
        -   **EXPLANATION**: Specifying method names like `get_completion` and focusing on error handling and API key management directs the AI to build a robust and usable client.
    -   **Key Considerations/Sub-Tasks**:
        * Constructor `__init__(self, api_key=None)` should load API key from config if not provided.
        * `get_completion(self, prompt, max_tokens, temperature, **kwargs)` method.
        * Implement fallback logic to Google PaLM if `XAI_API_KEY` is missing or `use_fallback` is true, using `GOOGLE_API_KEY`.
        * Use a library like `requests` for HTTP calls if no official xAI SDK is available (prepare for placeholder/mocked API calls initially).
        * Implement proper error handling for API responses (e.g., rate limits, authentication errors, using `APIError` from `src/utils/error_handling.py`).
        * Add docstrings explaining parameters and return values.
    -   **Files**:
        * `src/ai/xai_client.py`
        * Update `src/ai/__init__.py` (export `XAIClient`)
        * `tests/ai/test_xai_client.py` (Likely Created)
    -   **Step Dependencies**: Step 5
    -   **User Instructions**: Obtain an xAI API key (if available, otherwise development will use the fallback) and add it to your `.env` file as `XAI_API_KEY`. Also, add `GOOGLE_API_KEY` if using the PaLM fallback.

**Step Completion Summary (2025-05-07 HH:MM - Inferred):**
* **Status:** Completed & Approved by User (Inferred from file existence and content)
* **Files Modified/Created:**
    * `src/ai/xai_client.py` (Created/Updated)
    * `src/ai/__init__.py` (Updated to export `XAIClient`)
    * `tests/ai/test_xai_client.py` (Likely Created)
* **Summary of Changes:**
    * `src/ai/xai_client.py`: Implemented `XAIClient` with `get_completion` method. Handles API key loading from config (Step 5) for xAI and Google (as fallback). Uses `requests` for API calls (mocked in tests). Includes error handling for API responses and network issues, raising `APIError`. Logic for `use_fallback` config is present.
    * `src/ai/__init__.py`: Assumed to be updated to export `XAIClient`.
    * `tests/ai/test_xai_client.py`: Assumed to be created with unit tests for the XAI client, likely mocking `requests.post` and testing API key handling, fallback logic, and error responses.
---

- [x] **Step 7: Implement prompt engineering module**
    -   **Task**: Develop `src/ai/prompt_engineering.py` with a primary function like `generate_interaction_prompt(original_post_content, active_account_info, target_account_info, ethena_knowledge_snippet, interaction_details, platform)`. This function should dynamically construct detailed prompts based on the context, leveraging `ETHENA_CORE_MESSAGE`, `get_base_ethena_persona`, and specific instructions derived from `data/docs/InstructionsFor*.md` files (passed via `interaction_details`).
        -   **EXPLANATION**: Being very specific about the function signature and its inputs (especially `interaction_details` for custom instructions) helps the AI understand the complexity and dynamism required for this core module.
    -   **Key Considerations/Sub-Tasks**:
        * Implement `get_base_ethena_persona(active_account_type)` to define base persona.
        * The `generate_interaction_prompt` should assemble sections: persona, core Ethena message, original post context (if any), target account context, relevant Ethena knowledge, and task-specific instructions (tone, goal, style examples from `interaction_details`).
        * Incorporate logic to select and format content from `InstructionsForOfficialToInstitution.md`, `InstructionsForOfficialToPartner.md`, and `InstructionsForInternToIntern.md` based on the `active_account_info.account_type` and `target_account_info.account_type`.
        * Handle platform-specific constraints (e.g., Twitter character limits).
        * Consider how `ethena_knowledge_snippet` (from Step 11) will be formatted and injected.
        * Include placeholders for future dynamic example loading if needed, but start with inline logic for instruction integration.
    -   **Files**:
        * `src/ai/prompt_engineering.py`
    -   **Step Dependencies**: Step 6 (implicitly, as prompts are for the xAI client), Step 2 (uses Account, Tweet models).
    -   **User Instructions**: Review the generated prompts for various scenarios (Official-to-Institution, Official-to-Partner, etc.) to ensure they accurately reflect the strategies in `InstructionsFor*.md` and `Ethena-AI-Agent-Roadmap.md`.

**Step Completion Summary (2025-05-07 HH:MM):**
* **Status:** Completed & Approved by User
* **Files Modified/Created:**
    * `src/ai/prompt_engineering.py`
    * `src/ai/__init__.py`
    * `tests/ai/test_prompt_engineering.py`
* **Summary of Changes:**
    * `src/ai/prompt_engineering.py`: Implemented `get_base_ethena_persona`, `get_instruction_set`, `generate_interaction_prompt`, and `generate_new_tweet_prompt` to dynamically construct prompts based on account types, interaction context, specific details, and platform constraints. Includes logic to simulate using instruction sets based on interacting account types.
    * `src/ai/__init__.py`: Updated to export the new prompt generation functions.
    * `tests/ai/test_prompt_engineering.py`: Added unit tests covering persona generation, instruction set selection, interaction prompt generation (various scenarios including different account types and minimal input), and new tweet prompt generation.
---

- [x] **Step 8: Develop tone analysis module**
    -   **Task**: Implement `src/ai/tone_analyzer.py` with a function `analyze_tone(text: str, method: Optional[str] = None) -> Dict[str, Any]` that returns tone (e.g., 'positive', 'negative', 'neutral'), sentiment score, subjectivity, and confidence. It should support different methods (TextBlob initially, configurable for xAI/Google PaLM later). Add `analyze_tweet_tone(tweet: Tweet) -> Tweet` to update Tweet objects.
        -   **EXPLANATION**: Specifying the output dictionary structure and the idea of configurable methods makes the task clearer and prepares for future enhancements.
    -   **Key Considerations/Sub-Tasks**:
        * Implement `_analyze_with_textblob(text)`.
        * Create placeholders `_analyze_with_xai(text)` and `_analyze_with_google_palm(text)`.
        * Use `get_config('tone_analysis.method')` to select the method.
        * The `analyze_tweet_tone` function should update the `tweet.tone` and `tweet.sentiment_score` fields of the `Tweet` model.
    -   **Files**:
        * `src/ai/tone_analyzer.py`
        * `src/ai/__init__.py` (updated)
        * `tests/ai/test_tone_analyzer.py`
    -   **Step Dependencies**: Step 2 (uses `Tweet` model), Step 6 (for future xAI/PaLM analysis methods, though TextBlob has no direct API client dependency).
    -   **User Instructions**: Test the TextBlob implementation with various sample texts to ensure reasonable tone detection.

**Step Completion Summary (2025-05-07 19:40):**
* **Status:** Completed & Approved by User
* **Files Modified/Created:**
    * `src/ai/tone_analyzer.py` (Created)
    * `src/ai/__init__.py` (Updated)
    * `tests/ai/test_tone_analyzer.py` (Created)
* **Summary of Changes:**
    * `src/ai/tone_analyzer.py`: Implemented `analyze_tone` and `analyze_tweet_tone` functions. `analyze_tone` uses TextBlob by default for sentiment analysis (positive, negative, neutral), returning score, subjectivity, and confidence. Placeholders for xAI and Google PaLM methods were added. `analyze_tweet_tone` updates `Tweet` objects with analysis results. Changelog and basic inline tests included. Corrected f-string errors in `__main__`.
    * `src/ai/__init__.py`: Updated to export `analyze_tone`, `analyze_tweet_tone`, and also ensured `get_base_ethena_persona` and `get_instruction_set` from `prompt_engineering` are exported. Changelog updated.
    * `tests/ai/test_tone_analyzer.py`: Created comprehensive unit tests for `_analyze_with_textblob`, `analyze_tone` (including method selection, fallback for unknown methods, and `NotImplementedError` for placeholders), and `analyze_tweet_tone`. Removed a test case for `analyze_tweet_tone` with empty content as the `Tweet` model disallows empty content. All 11 tests pass.
---

- [x] **Step 9: Implement response generator**
    -   **Task**: Create `src/ai/response_generator.py` with main functions like `generate_tweet_reply(tweet, responding_as, target_account, ...)` and `generate_new_tweet(category, responding_as, topic, ...)`. These functions will orchestrate calls to tone analysis (Step 8), knowledge retrieval (Step 11), prompt engineering (Step 7), and the xAI client (Step 6) to produce an `AIResponse` object.
        -   **EXPLANATION**: Clearly defining the primary functions and their orchestration role helps structure this central AI logic module. Outputting a structured `AIResponse` object is key.
    -   **Key Considerations/Sub-Tasks**:
        * `generate_tweet_reply` should:
            * Analyze tone of input `tweet` (using module from Step 8).
            * Determine context for `interaction_details` (e.g. by mapping `responding_as` and `target_account.account_type` to the correct `Instructions*.md` content).
            * Fetch relevant `ethena_knowledge_snippet` (using module from Step 11 - **mocked for this step**).
            * Call `generate_interaction_prompt` (from Step 7).
            * Call `xai_client.get_completion` (from Step 6).
            * Package result into an `AIResponse` object.
        * `generate_new_tweet` should similarly construct context, get knowledge, generate prompt, call AI, and package.
        * Implement comprehensive error handling for each step of the generation process.
    -   **Files**:
        * `src/ai/response_generator.py`
        * `src/ai/__init__.py` (updated)
        * `tests/ai/test_response_generator.py`
    -   **Step Dependencies**: Step 6, Step 7, Step 8. (Will also depend on Step 11 once implemented).
    -   **User Instructions**: Test with various mock tweets and account types to ensure responses are contextually appropriate and use the correct personas/tones.

    * `tests/ai/test_response_generator.py` (Created)
* **Summary of Changes:**
    * `src/ai/response_generator.py`: Implemented `generate_tweet_reply` and `generate_new_tweet`. These functions orchestrate calls to tone analysis (Step 8), prompt engineering (Step 7), and the XAI client (Step 6). Knowledge retrieval (Step 11) is currently mocked with an internal `MockKnowledgeRetriever`. Includes logic for parsing AI response structures and robust error handling. Returns an `AIResponse` object with correctly mapped fields (`responding_as`, `target_account`, `generation_time`).
    * `src/ai/__init__.py`: Updated to export `generate_tweet_reply` and `generate_new_tweet`.
    * `tests/ai/test_response_generator.py`: Created 6 unit tests covering successful reply/new tweet generation, API errors, prompt generation errors, and different AI response structures. All tests pass with mocked dependencies.

## Ethena Knowledge Integration

- [x] **Step 10: Create Ethena knowledge base module**
    -   **Task**: Implement `src/knowledge/base.py` with a `KnowledgeSource` abstract interface. Create `src/knowledge/ethena.py` with `StaticJSONKnowledgeSource` (reading from `data/docs/ethena_knowledge.json`) and a `EthenaDocsKnowledgeSource` (reading from `data/docs/docs.ethena.fi.md`). Plan for a `LiveEthenaDataSource` for fetching live metrics as per the roadmap.
        -   **EXPLANATION**: Defining interfaces and specific classes for different knowledge types (static JSON, Markdown docs, live data) makes the system extensible and clear about how different knowledge is handled.
    -   **Key Considerations/Sub-Tasks**:
        * `KnowledgeSource` interface: Define methods like `get_info(topic: str, query: Optional[str] = None) -> Optional[str]` or `search(query: str) -> List[RelevantChunk]`.
        * `StaticJSONKnowledgeSource`: Load and query `ethena_knowledge.json`.
        * `EthenaDocsKnowledgeSource`: Parse `docs.ethena.fi.md` (potentially chunking it) to allow searching or querying sections. Basic keyword search or section matching initially.
        * Populate `data/docs/ethena_knowledge.json` with key facts, product details, FAQs, current (manually updated for now) APYs/TVL.
        * Consider how to structure `ethena_knowledge.json` for easy querying (e.g., nested dictionaries).
    -   **Files**:
        * `src/knowledge/base.py`
        * `src/knowledge/ethena.py`
        * `src/knowledge/__init__.py`
        * `data/docs/ethena_knowledge.json`
    -   **Step Dependencies**: Step 1 (for file paths).
    -   **User Instructions**: Populate `ethena_knowledge.json` with accurate and comprehensive current information about Ethena's products, services, and key metrics. Ensure `data/docs/docs.ethena.fi.md` is the up-to-date whitepaper/documentation.

**Step Completion Summary (2025-05-07 20:35):**
* **Status:** Completed & Approved by User
* **Files Modified/Created:**
    * `src/knowledge/base.py` (Created)
    * `src/knowledge/ethena.py` (Created)
    * `src/knowledge/__init__.py` (Created)
    * `data/docs/ethena_knowledge.json` (Created by AI, then updated & expanded by User)
* **Summary of Changes:**
    * `src/knowledge/base.py`: Defined the `KnowledgeSource` abstract base class, which includes an abstract `search` method and a `name` property. Also defined the `RelevantChunk` dataclass to structure search results, including content, source name, score, and metadata.
    * `src/knowledge/ethena.py`: Implemented `StaticJSONKnowledgeSource`, which loads data from `data/docs/ethena_knowledge.json`. Its `search` method performs a recursive, case-insensitive keyword search within the JSON structure, prioritizing FAQ answers by prepending the question to the answer content in the chunk. Implemented `EthenaDocsKnowledgeSource` to load data from `data/docs/docs.ethena.fi.md`, splitting the content into paragraphs and performing a case-insensitive keyword search. Both classes include robust error handling for file loading (non-existent files, JSON decoding errors) and log relevant information. A placeholder for `LiveEthenaDataSource` was also included. A basic `if __name__ == '__main__':` block was added for local testing of these sources.
    * `src/knowledge/__init__.py`: Created to export `KnowledgeSource`, `RelevantChunk`, `StaticJSONKnowledgeSource`, and `EthenaDocsKnowledgeSource` for easy access from other modules.
    * `data/docs/ethena_knowledge.json`: Initially created by the AI with placeholder data. The user then populated this file with more comprehensive and accurate information regarding Ethena's products, FAQs, key metrics, security details, and tokenomics as per the step's user instructions.
---

- [x] **Step 11: Implement knowledge retrieval system**
    -   **Task**: Develop `src/knowledge/retrieval.py` with a `KnowledgeRetriever` class. This class will use the `KnowledgeSource` implementations (from Step 10) to find and return the most relevant knowledge snippets based on the input query or context (e.g., content of a tweet to reply to, topic for a new tweet).
        -   **EXPLANATION**: A dedicated retriever class that can work with multiple knowledge sources centralizes the logic for finding relevant information, making the `response_generator` cleaner.
    -   **Key Considerations/Sub-Tasks**:
        * `KnowledgeRetriever` should be able to register multiple `KnowledgeSource` instances.
        * Implement a strategy to query these sources (e.g., query all, use heuristics to pick a source).
        * For `EthenaDocsKnowledgeSource`, implement basic text processing (e.g., splitting into paragraphs/sections) and search functionality (e.g., keyword matching, TF-IDF, or simple string search).
        * The output should be a concise string or list of strings suitable for injection into prompts.
        * Roadmap: "Chat with Whitepaper/Docs - enable by gitbook only." This implies needing to process GitBook-style markdown or potentially integrate directly if an API exists. For now, `docs.ethena.fi.md` is the source.
    -   **Files**:
        * `src/knowledge/retrieval.py`
    -   **Step Dependencies**: Step 10
    -   **User Instructions**: Test the retrieval with various queries to ensure it pulls relevant information from both `ethena_knowledge.json` and `docs.ethena.fi.md`.

## Twitter API Integration Framework

- [x] **Step 12: Design Twitter API data source interface**
    -   **Task**: Flesh out the `src/data_sources/twitter.py` file by defining a `TwitterDataSource` class that inherits from `TweetDataSource` (Step 3). Implement method signatures placeholder (e.g., `pass` or `raise NotImplementedError`). This class will use `tweepy` or a similar library.
        -   **EXPLANATION**: Creating the class structure and method placeholders clearly defines the scope of work for live Twitter integration.
    -   **Key Considerations/Sub-Tasks**:
        * Ensure all methods from `TweetDataSource` are defined.
        * Plan for how `tweepy.Client` or other Twitter library objects will be initialized and used (likely via `twitter_auth.py`).
        * Consider error handling specific to Twitter API responses.
    -   **Files**:
        * `src/data_sources/twitter.py`
    -   **Step Dependencies**: Step 3
    -   **User Instructions**: Review the Twitter API v2 documentation for rate limits, authentication, and endpoint capabilities relevant to the methods in `TweetDataSource`. Ensure you have applied for Twitter Developer Access with the appropriate level.

- [x] **Step 13: Implement Twitter API authentication**
    -   **Task**: Implement `src/data_sources/twitter_auth.py` to handle Twitter API v2 authentication (e.g., Bearer Token for app-only access, OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Flow with PKCE for user context actions if needed for posting). Store and retrieve credentials securely using the configuration system (Step 5).
        -   **EXPLANATION**: Secure and correct authentication is non-negotiable for API access. Separating it into its own module is good practice.
    -   **Key Considerations/Sub-Tasks**:
        * Function to get an authenticated `tweepy.Client` instance.
        * Securely load API keys, secrets, and tokens from `.env` via the config system.
        * Implement logic for token refresh if using OAuth user context.
    -   **Files**:
        * `src/data_sources/twitter_auth.py`
    -   **Step Dependencies**: Step 12 (knows it will need an auth client), Step 5 (for credentials).
    -   **User Instructions**: Obtain your Twitter API v2 credentials (API Key, API Secret, Bearer Token, and if needed for user context, Access Token & Secret) and add them to your `.env` file.

## Web Interface

- [x] **Step 14: Create basic Streamlit app**
    -   **Task**: Implement `app.py` (or `src/app.py`) as the main Streamlit application. Set up basic page configuration, title, and placeholders for UI sections (e.g., tweet input, response display, configuration sidebar). Create `src/ui/__init__.py` and an empty `src/ui/components.py`.
        -   **EXPLANATION**: A minimal but structured Streamlit app provides the canvas for adding specific UI elements in subsequent steps.
    -   **Key Considerations/Sub-Tasks**:
        * Use `st.set_page_config()`.
        * Add a title and a brief description.
        * Create a sidebar for selecting Ethena persona (Official/Intern) and interaction type (Reply/New Tweet).
        * Main area with placeholders for dynamic content based on sidebar selection.
        * Load necessary configurations and initialize any global objects (like a data source instance).
    -   **Files**:
        * `app.py` (or `src/app.py`)
        * `src/ui/__init__.py`
        * `src/ui/components.py`
    -   **Step Dependencies**: Step 4 (Mock Data Source, for initial UI data), Step 9 (Response Generator, to call when UI form is submitted), Step 11 (Knowledge Retrieval, as part of response generation).
    -   **User Instructions**: Run the Streamlit app with `streamlit run app.py` to ensure the basic layout and placeholders appear correctly.

**Step Completion Summary (2025-05-07 HH:MM):**
* **Status:** Completed & Approved by User
* **Files Modified/Created:**
    * `app.py` (Created/Updated)
    * `src/ui/__init__.py` (Created/Updated)
    * `src/ui/components.py` (Created/Updated with `status_badge`, `collapsible_container`, `copy_button`)
    * `src/ui/tweet_input.py` (Created and significantly developed)
    * `src/config/settings.py` (Updated for API key loading robustness)
    * `src/ai/xai_client.py` (Updated for correct API endpoint and payload)
    * `config.yaml` (Updated for API key placeholders and `xai_model`)
* **Summary of Changes:**
    * `app.py`: Basic Streamlit application structure set up. Includes page configuration, title, sidebar for persona selection, and main area for interaction type selection (Tweet Reply / New Tweet). It calls `display_tweet_reply_ui` and (conceptually) `display_new_tweet_ui`.
    * `src/ui/__init__.py`: Standard init file.
    * `src/ui/components.py`: Implemented helper UI components like `status_badge`, `collapsible_container`, and `copy_button` used for displaying AI response metadata and actions.
    * `src/ui/tweet_input.py`: This file became the core for Step 15 and 16 as well. It handles input for tweet URL or manual content, author details, triggers reply generation via `response_generator.generate_tweet_reply`, displays the AI-generated reply, tone, and includes a copy button. Robust error handling and loading spinners (`st.spinner`) were added. Logger was integrated.
    * Configuration files (`settings.py`, `config.yaml`) and `xai_client.py` were updated to ensure correct and stable API key loading and API interaction, resolving previous errors.
    * The application now successfully generates and displays AI replies for manually entered tweet content.
---

- [x] **Step 15: Implement tweet input interface**
    -   **Task**: In `src/ui/tweet_input.py`, create UI elements for inputting a tweet URL (to fetch and reply to) or manually entering tweet content and target account details for generating a reply.
        -   **EXPLANATION**: Clear input fields are crucial for user experience. This task focuses on how the user provides context for tweet replies.
    -   **Key Considerations/Sub-Tasks**:
        * `st.text_input` for tweet URL.
        * `st.text_area` for manual tweet content.
        * Inputs for target account username/type if not derivable from URL.
        * Button to trigger reply generation.
        * Logic to call `MockTweetDataSource.get_tweet_by_url()` or use manual content.
        * Logic to call `response_generator.generate_tweet_reply()`.
    -   **Files**:
        * `src/ui/tweet_input.py`
    -   **Step Dependencies**: Step 14
    -   **User Instructions**: Test the input fields and ensure the data is correctly passed to the backend when the "Generate Reply" button is clicked.
---
**Step Completion Summary (2025-05-07 HH:MM):**
* **Status:** Completed & Approved by User
* **Files Modified/Created:**
    * `src/ui/tweet_input.py` (Primarily)
* **Summary of Changes:**
    * `src/ui/tweet_input.py`: Implemented comprehensive UI elements for tweet input. This includes `st.text_input` for a tweet URL and `st.text_area` for manual tweet content. Inputs for original author username and account type were added for when manual content is provided. The logic correctly prioritizes manual content if both URL and manual content are given (though URL fetching itself is mock/placeholder). The "Generate Reply" button triggers a call to `response_generator.generate_tweet_reply` using the constructed `Tweet` object and selected persona. Includes error handling for missing inputs and displays fetched/manual content for user verification.
---

- [x] **Step 16: Develop response visualization**
    -   **Task**: In `src/ui/response_view.py` (or `app.py`), create UI components to display the AI-generated tweet reply, including the original tweet (if applicable), the suggested reply, and any metadata like tone or confidence.
        -   **EXPLANATION**: Effective presentation of the AI's output allows the user to quickly assess and use the suggestion.
    -   **Key Considerations/Sub-Tasks**:
        * Display original tweet content.
        * Display `AIResponse.content` clearly.
        * Show metadata like `AIResponse.tone`, `AIResponse.model_used`.
        * Add a "Copy to Clipboard" button for the suggested reply.
        * Potentially allow for editing the suggestion.
    -   **Files**:
        * `src/ui/response_view.py` (or modify `app.py`)
        * `src/ui/tweet_input.py` (where it was implemented)
        * `src/ui/components.py` (for copy button, status badge)
    -   **Step Dependencies**: Step 15
    -   **User Instructions**: Verify that the AI's response and relevant metadata are displayed clearly and accurately. Test the copy functionality.
---
**Step Completion Summary (2025-05-07 HH:MM):**
* **Status:** Completed & Approved by User
* **Files Modified/Created:**
    * `src/ui/tweet_input.py` (Display logic integrated here)
    * `src/ui/components.py` (Used for `status_badge` and `copy_button`)
* **Summary of Changes:**
    * The AI-generated reply (`AIResponse.reply`) is displayed clearly using `st.success()` within `src/ui/tweet_input.py`.
    * Metadata, specifically the `tone`, is displayed using the `status_badge` component from `src/ui/components.py`.
    * A "Copy to Clipboard" button (from `src/ui/components.py`) was added next to the generated reply, allowing users to easily copy the text.
    * The original tweet content (either fetched via URL or manually entered) is displayed for context before the AI reply.
    * The system now provides a functional loop for inputting tweet details, generating a reply, and viewing/copying that reply along with its tone.
---

## Category-Based Tweet Generation

- [x] **Step 17: Implement category definition system**
    -   **Task**: Create `src/models/category.py` defining a `TweetCategory` dataclass/enum. Populate `data/input/categories.json` with a list of categories (name, description, example prompts/keywords) relevant to Ethena (e.g., Announcement, Product Update, Community Update, Event, Security, Transparency).
        -   **EXPLANATION**: A structured way to define categories makes it easier to manage them and for the AI to generate targeted content. JSON is a good choice for configurable category data.
    -   **Key Considerations/Sub-Tasks**:
        * `TweetCategory` model: `name: str`, `description: str`, `prompt_keywords: List[str]`, `style_guidelines: Dict`.
        * Load categories from `categories.json` in `app.py` or a config/utility function.
        * Ensure categories in `config.yaml` under `tweet_categories` align or are loaded from this JSON.
    -   **Files**:
        * `src/models/category.py`
        * `data/input/categories.json`
        * Update `src/models/__init__.py`
    -   **Step Dependencies**: Step 2 (for base model understanding).
    -   **User Instructions**: Customize `data/input/categories.json` with Ethena-specific categories, providing clear descriptions and keywords/examples for each to guide AI generation.

**Step Completion Summary (2025-05-08 HH:MM):**
* **Status:** Completed & Approved by User
* **Files Modified/Created:**
    * `src/models/category.py` (Created)
    * `data/input/categories.json` (Created/Updated)
    * `src/models/__init__.py` (Updated)
* **Summary of Changes:**
    * `src/models/category.py`: Implemented `TweetCategory` dataclass with required attributes (`name`, `description`, `prompt_keywords`, `style_guidelines`) and helper methods including `from_dict` and loading from JSON.
    * `data/input/categories.json`: Populated with Ethena-specific tweet categories, including descriptions, prompt keywords, and style guidelines for each.
    * `src/models/__init__.py`: Updated to export the `TweetCategory` class.
---

- [x] **Step 18: Create category-based prompt engineering**
    -   **Task**: Extend `src/ai/prompt_engineering.py` (or create `src/ai/category_prompts.py`) with functions to generate prompts tailored for creating new tweets based on a selected category, topic, and Ethena knowledge.
        -   **EXPLANATION**: Prompts for generating new tweets will differ significantly from reply prompts and vary by category.
    -   **Key Considerations/Sub-Tasks**:
        * Function like `generate_new_tweet_prompt(category: TweetCategory, topic: Optional[str], ethena_knowledge_snippet: str, active_account_info: Account)`.
        * Use `category.description`, `category.prompt_keywords`, and `category.style_guidelines` to construct the prompt.
        * Incorporate the `topic` provided by the user.
    -   **Files**:
        * Modify `src/ai/prompt_engineering.py` or create `src/ai/category_prompts.py`.
    -   **Step Dependencies**: Step 7, Step 17.
    -   **User Instructions**: Review generated prompts for different categories to ensure they accurately reflect the category's intent and provide good guidance to the LLM.

---
**Step Completion Summary (2025-05-08 HH:MM):**
* **Status:** Completed & Approved by User
* **Files Modified/Created:**
    * `src/ai/prompt_engineering.py` (Updated)
* **Summary of Changes:**
    * `src/ai/prompt_engineering.py`: Updated to include a `generate_new_tweet_prompt` function that accepts a `TweetCategory` object and uses its attributes (name, description, prompt_keywords, style_guidelines) to create tailored prompts for new tweet generation.
    * The function also handles additional parameters like topic, account type, and Ethena knowledge to provide comprehensive context to the AI model.
    * Added proper type hinting and docstrings for clarity and robustness.
---

- [x] **Step 19: Develop category selection UI**
    -   **Task**: In `src/ui/category_select.py` (or `app.py`), create UI components for selecting a tweet category (from Step 17), inputting a topic/brief, and triggering the generation of a new tweet.
    -   **Key Considerations/Sub-Tasks**:
        * `st.selectbox` to choose from available categories.
        * `st.text_area` for the user to provide a topic or key points for the tweet.
        * Button to generate the tweet.
        * Logic to call `response_generator.generate_new_tweet()`.
        * Display the generated tweet using response visualization components (from Step 16).
    -   **Files**:
        * `src/ui/category_select.py` (or modify `app.py`)
    -   **Step Dependencies**: Step 16 (for response display), Step 17 (for category list).
    -   **User Instructions**: Test the category selection and topic input. Ensure the correct information is passed to the backend and the generated tweet is displayed.
---
**Step Completion Summary (2025-05-07 22:00):**
* **Status:** Completed & Approved by User
* **Files Modified/Created:**
    * `src/ui/category_select.py`
    * `app.py`
* **Summary of Changes:**
    * `src/ui/category_select.py`: Created UI components for selecting a category, entering a topic, and generating/displaying a new tweet. Integrated `generate_new_tweet` and session state for error/content handling.
    * `app.py`: Updated to call `display_category_tweet_ui` instead of the placeholder `display_new_tweet_ui`, imported the new module, and removed legacy placeholder code.
---

## Testing and Evaluation

- [ ] **Step 20: Implement automated testing**
    -   **Task**: Create unit tests in `tests/` for core modules: `data_sources` (especially `MockTweetDataSource`), `ai` modules (`prompt_engineering`, `tone_analyzer`, `response_generator`, `xai_client` with mocked API calls), and `knowledge` modules. Use `pytest`.
        -   **EXPLANATION**: Comprehensive unit tests ensure individual components function correctly and prevent regressions. Mocking external dependencies (like xAI API) is crucial for testing AI logic in isolation.
    -   **Key Considerations/Sub-Tasks**:
        * Create `tests/test_models.py`, `tests/test_data_sources.py`, `tests/test_config.py`.
        * Create `tests/ai/test_prompt_engineering.py`, `tests/ai/test_tone_analyzer.py`, `tests/ai/test_response_generator.py` (mocking `XAIClient`), `tests/ai/test_xai_client.py` (mocking HTTP requests or xAI SDK if used).
        * Create `tests/knowledge/test_knowledge_retrieval.py`.
        * Aim for good test coverage of critical logic and edge cases.
        * Use `pytest` fixtures for setting up test data (e.g., sample `Tweet`, `Account` objects).
    -   **Files**:
        * `tests/test_data_sources.py`
        * `tests/ai/test_prompt_engineering.py` (example, structure as needed)
        * `tests/ai/test_response_generator.py`
        * `tests/knowledge/test_knowledge_retrieval.py`
        * Corresponding `__init__.py` in `tests/` and `tests/ai/` etc.
    -   **Step Dependencies**: Steps 1-19 (as it tests components built in these steps).
    -   **User Instructions**: Run tests with `pytest tests/`. Aim for all tests to pass. Review test coverage.

- [ ] **Step 21: Create evaluation framework**
    -   **Task**: Implement `src/evaluation/metrics.py` (e.g., defining metrics like content relevance, tone adherence, factual accuracy check placeholders) and `src/evaluation/evaluator.py` (logic to run evaluations, potentially comparing AI output against golden answers or using human feedback).
        -   **EXPLANATION**: A structured way to evaluate response quality is essential for understanding AI performance and identifying areas for improvement.
    -   **Key Considerations/Sub-Tasks**:
        * Define what "quality" means for your responses (e.g., relevance, tone, factual accuracy, engagement potential).
        * `metrics.py`: Functions to calculate or assess these (some might be qualitative).
        * `evaluator.py`: A class or functions to take an `AIResponse` (and perhaps a reference answer/context) and apply metrics.
        * Consider a simple UI or script to facilitate batch evaluation or human review.
    -   **Files**:
        * `src/evaluation/metrics.py`
        * `src/evaluation/evaluator.py`
        * `src/evaluation/__init__.py`
    -   **Step Dependencies**: Step 9 (needs generated responses to evaluate).
    -   **User Instructions**: Define a small set of "golden" test cases (input tweet/scenario + ideal response) to test the evaluation framework.

## Deployment

- [ ] **Step 22: Prepare for production deployment**
    -   **Task**: Create a `Dockerfile` for containerizing the Streamlit application, a `docker-compose.yml` for local orchestration (if needed), and a basic `scripts/deploy.sh` (placeholder for actual deployment commands to a chosen platform).
        -   **EXPLANATION**: Containerization ensures consistent deployment across environments.
    -   **Key Considerations/Sub-Tasks**:
        * `Dockerfile`: Based on Python, copies code, installs `requirements.txt`, exposes Streamlit port, sets entrypoint.
        * `docker-compose.yml`: Define service for the app, manage environment variables, port mappings.
        * `deploy.sh`: Placeholder with comments for future deployment steps (e.g., build image, push to registry, deploy to cloud service).
    -   **Files**:
        * `Dockerfile`
        * `docker-compose.yml`
        * `scripts/deploy.sh`
    -   **Step Dependencies**: Steps 1-21 (a complete, tested application).
    -   **User Instructions**: Follow the deployment instructions in the `README.md` (to be updated in Step 23) to test building and running the Docker container locally.

- [x] **Step 23: Document API and usage**
    -   **Task**: Create comprehensive documentation: `docs/api.md` (if the agent exposes any programmatic APIs, not the case for a simple Streamlit app unless you add a backend API), `docs/usage.md` (how to use the Streamlit app, interpret outputs), `docs/deployment.md` (how to deploy). Update `README.md` with final instructions.
        -   **EXPLANATION**: Good documentation is vital for usability and maintainability.
    -   **Key Considerations/Sub-Tasks**:
        * `README.md`: Final setup, usage, configuration.
        * `docs/usage.md`: Detailed guide for end-users of the Streamlit app.
        * `docs/deployment.md`: Steps for deploying the Docker container.
        * Ensure all configurations and environment variables are documented.
    -   **Files**:
        * `docs/` (directory, if not existing)
        * `docs/api.md` (if applicable)
        * `docs/usage.md`
        * `docs/deployment.md`
        * Update `README.md`

---
**Step Completion Summary (2025-05-08 HH:MM):**
* **Status:** Completed & Approved by User
* **Files Modified/Created:**
    * `docs/usage.md` (Updated)
    * `docs/api.md` (Updated)
    * `README.md` (Updated)

## Implementation Approach Summary
This summary provides an excellent high-level view of the development philosophy.
- **Abstraction**: Clear interfaces (like `TweetDataSource`, `KnowledgeSource`) allow for future changes without impacting the entire system.
- **Modularity**: Separating concerns into distinct components (`ai`, `data_sources`, `knowledge`, `models`, `ui`) makes development, testing, and maintenance much easier.
- **Scalability**: The design allows for adding new data sources (Twitter, Discord, Telegram), new knowledge sources, and more complex AI logic or UI features over time.
- **Usability**: The plan includes steps for a Streamlit UI, which aims to provide an intuitive way to interact with the agent.
The iterative approach (core data, AI, UI, then enhancements) is sound. Key considerations like security, testing, and documentation are well-integrated.
